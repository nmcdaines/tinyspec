# Dashboard

The tinyspec dashboard is an interactive terminal UI (TUI) for monitoring spec progress in real time.

```
tinyspec dashboard
```

## List view

The main screen shows all specs organized into two sections:

- **In Progress** — specs with at least one completed task but not all
- **Completed** — specs where all tasks are done

Each row displays:

```
● 2026-02-18 my-feature  ██████░░░░  6/10
```

- A status icon: `●` yellow (in progress), `○` gray (pending), `✓` green (complete)
- The spec timestamp and name
- A 10-character progress bar
- Task completion count

Specs in groups show a group header with an aggregate completion percentage.

### Auto-refresh

The dashboard watches the `.specs/` directory for changes and updates automatically. When you or Claude checks off tasks, the progress updates in real time.

## Detail view

Press Enter on any spec to open its detail view. This shows the spec's Implementation Plan with:

- Top-level tasks with expand/collapse arrows and child progress counts (`[3/5]`)
- Subtasks with checkbox indicators (`☐` unchecked, `✓` checked)
- Unchecked tasks appear first, followed by a separator, then completed tasks

Press Enter or Space on a top-level task to toggle its subtask list.
