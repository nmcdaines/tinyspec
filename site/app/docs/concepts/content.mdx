# Concepts

## Spec structure

Every tinyspec specification is a Markdown file with YAML front matter and four sections.

### Front matter

```yaml
---
tinySpec: v0
title: My Feature
applications:
  - my-app
---
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tinySpec` | Format version (currently `v0`) |
| `title` | Human-readable title, auto-generated from the spec name |
| `applications` | List of repository names for multi-repo specs (optional) |

### Background

Context on the domain and the problem you're solving. This section is written by you and helps Claude understand *why* the work is needed.

### Proposal

A description of the proposed changes — what will be built or changed. Write this with enough detail that someone could review and approve the approach.

### Implementation Plan

A structured checklist of work. This is typically scaffolded by the `/tinyspec-refine` skill and then reviewed by you.

```markdown
- [ ] A: Set up database schema
  - [ ] A.1: Create users table migration
  - [ ] A.2: Add indexes for email and username
- [ ] B: Implement API endpoints
  - [ ] B.1: POST /users endpoint
  - [ ] B.2: GET /users/:id endpoint
```

### Test Plan

An optional section for test cases using Given/When/Then syntax:

```markdown
- [ ] T.1: User creation
  - **Given** no user with email "test@example.com" exists
  - **When** POST /users is called with valid data
  - **Then** a 201 response is returned
  - **And** the user appears in the database
```

## Task groups and subtasks

Work in the Implementation Plan is organized into **task groups** identified by letters (A, B, C...) and **subtasks** using dotted notation (A.1, A.2, A.3...).

Task groups represent logical units of work — typically a feature, a layer, or a phase. Subtasks break each group into individual steps. The `/tinyspec-do` skill implements groups in order, committing after each group completes.

### Task ID format

- Top-level: a single letter — `A`, `B`, `C`
- Subtasks: letter dot number — `A.1`, `A.2`, `B.1`
- The colon after the ID is required: `- [ ] A.1: Description`

## Spec lifecycle

A spec typically moves through these phases:

1. **Create** — `tinyspec new my-feature` scaffolds the file
2. **Define** — you write the Background and Proposal
3. **Refine** — `/tinyspec-refine` asks questions, suggests improvements, and builds the Implementation Plan
4. **Implement** — `/tinyspec-do` or `/tinyspec-task` executes the plan
5. **Complete** — all tasks checked off, code committed

You can iterate between phases. Running `/tinyspec-refine` again updates the plan. Tasks can be unchecked with `tinyspec uncheck` to redo work.

## Spec organization

Specs live in the `.specs/` directory at the root of your repository. Filenames include a timestamp prefix:

```
.specs/2026-02-18-14-30-my-feature.md
```

You can organize specs into groups using subdirectories:

```
.specs/v1/2026-02-18-14-30-auth.md
.specs/v1/2026-02-18-15-00-dashboard.md
.specs/v2/2026-02-19-09-00-redesign.md
```

Create a grouped spec with slash notation:

```
tinyspec new v1/auth
```

Spec names must be globally unique across all groups.
