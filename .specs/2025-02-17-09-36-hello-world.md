# Background
There are a series spectification standards

# Proposal

The goal of tiny spec is to be a simple and light specification format for describing software components and their interactions. They should be easy to read and write, useful for planning and instructing a language model, provide context on a system to a language model.

Specifications are written in markdown typically stored in a .specs/ directory of a project.
- They use front matter to define metadata about the specification such as tinySpec version, title, applications affected, and other relevant information.
- The body of the specification can contain detailed descriptions, instructions, and any other information necessary to understand the system or component being described.

The body of the tinyspec specification has a clear structure with sections such as "Proposal"
