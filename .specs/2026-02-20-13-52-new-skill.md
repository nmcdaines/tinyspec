# Background

Tinyspec ships four Claude Code skills via `tinyspec init`: `tinyspec:refine`, `tinyspec:do`, `tinyspec:task`, and `tinyspec:oneshot`. Each skill is defined as a Markdown file in `src/skills/`, embedded into the binary with `include_str!`, and written to `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` during init.

The existing entry point for creating a spec is `tinyspec new <spec-name>`, which creates a blank `.specs/<timestamp>-<name>.md` file from the default template. From there the user either fills it in manually or runs `tinyspec:refine` to collaborate with Claude on the content.

There is no skill that combines these two steps — creating the file and drafting initial content — into a single command. Users who want to start a spec from a natural-language description have to (a) manually derive a spec name, (b) run `tinyspec new`, and (c) separately invoke `tinyspec:refine`. This friction discourages writing specs for smaller or exploratory changes.

# Proposal

Add a `tinyspec:new` skill that accepts a natural-language description as its argument. The skill:

1. Derives a short kebab-case spec name from the description.
1. Runs `tinyspec new <spec-name>` to create the file.
1. Explores the current repository (or referenced application repos if configured) to ground the spec in real codebase context.
1. Populates the `# Background` and `# Proposal` sections with an initial draft based on the description and exploration.
1. Runs `tinyspec format <spec-name>` to normalise formatting.
1. Transitions into the full `tinyspec:refine` collaborative workflow — asking clarifying questions, suggesting improvements, scaffolding the Implementation Plan, and waiting for user approval before committing any changes.

The skill source lives at `src/skills/tinyspec-new.md` and is registered in `src/spec/init.rs` alongside the other skills, so it is installed by `tinyspec init` like the rest.

# Implementation Plan

- [x] A: Add skill source file
  - [x] A.1: Create `src/skills/tinyspec-new.md` with the full skill prompt
- [x] B: Register skill in the binary
  - [x] B.1: Add `TINYSPEC_NEW_SKILL` constant with `include_str!` in `src/spec/init.rs`
  - [x] B.2: Add `("tinyspec-new", TINYSPEC_NEW_SKILL)` to the skills slice in `init()`
- [x] C: Deploy skill to current project
  - [x] C.1: Create `.claude/skills/tinyspec-new/SKILL.md` so the skill is available without rebuilding
