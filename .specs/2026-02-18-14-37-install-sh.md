# Background

The current install method for tinyspec requires the user to have the Rust toolchain (Cargo) installed (`cargo install tinyspec`). This is a barrier for users who just want the CLI binary without setting up a Rust development environment.

Release artifacts already exist on GitHub for macOS (arm64, x86_64), Linux (x86_64), and Windows (x86_64), but no SHA256 checksums are published alongside them. The marketing site (Next.js app in `site/`) and getting-started docs only document the Cargo install method.

# Proposal

Create an `install.sh` script that auto-detects the user's OS and architecture, downloads the correct pre-built binary from GitHub releases, verifies its SHA256 checksum, and installs it to `~/.local/bin`. The script should support macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux (x86_64), and Windows via WSL.

Host `install.sh` as a static file on the marketing site (`site/public/install.sh` → `https://tinyspec.dev/install.sh`) so users can install with a single curl command.

Update the release workflow to generate and publish SHA256 checksums. Update the marketing site Install component and getting-started docs to present both install methods: the quick curl one-liner and the existing Cargo install.

# Implementation Plan

- [x] A: Release workflow — add checksums
  - [x] A.1: Add a step to the release job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` that generates a `checksums.txt` (SHA256) for all artifacts
  - [x] A.2: Include `checksums.txt` in the GitHub release assets alongside the existing binaries
- [ ] B: Create install.sh
  - [ ] B.1: Write `site/public/install.sh` — detect OS/arch, map to the correct artifact name, fetch the latest release tag via the GitHub API, download the binary tarball, verify SHA256 against `checksums.txt`, extract and install to `~/.local/bin`, and print a PATH hint if `~/.local/bin` is not in PATH
  - [ ] B.2: Handle error cases: unsupported platform, missing curl/wget, checksum mismatch, download failure, and `~/.local/bin` not in PATH
- [ ] C: Update marketing site
  - [ ] C.1: Update `site/app/components/Install.tsx` to show a tab or toggle between "Quick install" (`curl -fsSL https://tinyspec.dev/install.sh | sh`) and "From source" (`cargo install tinyspec`)
  - [ ] C.2: Update `site/app/docs/getting-started/content.mdx` to document both install methods
- [ ] D: Verification
  - [ ] D.1: 🧪 Run `cargo test` upon completion

# Test Plan

- [ ] T.1: Given a machine without Rust installed, when the user runs `curl -fsSL https://tinyspec.dev/install.sh | sh`, then tinyspec is downloaded, verified, and installed to `~/.local/bin`, and the binary runs successfully
- [ ] T.2: Given a tampered or corrupted artifact, when the install script verifies the SHA256 checksum, then it aborts with a clear error message and does not install the binary
- [ ] T.3: Given `~/.local/bin` is not in the user's PATH, when the install completes, then the script prints a hint showing how to add it to PATH
