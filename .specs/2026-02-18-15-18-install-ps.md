# Background

We have an install script (`install.sh`) for Linux and macOS users that provides a one-line install experience. Windows users currently have no equivalent — the install.sh script errors on Windows and directs them to `cargo install tinyspec`. However, the Windows binary (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`) is already built and published in GitHub releases with SHA256 checksums.

# Proposal

Create an `install.ps1` PowerShell script that mirrors `install.sh` behavior: detect architecture, download the correct binary from GitHub releases, verify SHA256 checksum, install to `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\tinyspec`, and auto-add to the user's PATH. Serve it at `tinyspec.dev/install.ps1` so users can run `irm https://tinyspec.dev/install.ps1 | iex`. Update the marketing site and docs to auto-detect the user's OS and show the appropriate install command.

# Implementation Plan

- [x] A: Create `install.ps1` PowerShell script
  - [x] A.1: Detect architecture (x86_64)
  - [x] A.2: Query GitHub API for latest release tag
  - [x] A.3: Download binary zip and `checksums.txt` from GitHub release
  - [x] A.4: Verify SHA256 checksum
  - [x] A.5: Extract binary to `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\tinyspec`
  - [x] A.6: Add install directory to user PATH via registry
  - [x] A.7: Print success message with version and PATH reload instructions
- [x] B: Serve `install.ps1` from the marketing site (`site/public/install.ps1`)
- [x] C: Update marketing site Install component to auto-detect OS and show the right command (`curl | sh` vs `irm | iex`)
- [x] D: Update docs getting-started page with Windows install instructions and OS-aware display
- [x] 🧪 Run `cargo test` upon completion
