# Background

Tinyspec is a CLI framework for writing structured specifications that integrate with Claude Code. It helps developers translate ideas into actionable, tracked implementation plans using a spec-driven workflow. Tinyspec needs a public-facing landing page to introduce the product, explain its value proposition, and help developers get started quickly. The site will live at a custom domain and serve as the primary marketing presence for tinyspec.

# Proposal

Build a Next.js landing page in the `site/` directory with a minimal, clean design (whitespace-heavy, monochrome with one accent color, developer-tool aesthetic). The page has three sections:

1. **Hero** — Tagline, one-liner description, and CTA (install command + GitHub link)
1. **Features** — Key capabilities: spec-driven workflow, Claude Code integration via slash commands, progress tracking with dashboard, multi-repo support, templates
1. **Install / Getting Started** — `cargo install tinyspec` command with quick-start steps

Deploy to GitHub Pages via a GitHub Actions workflow. Configure for a custom domain.

Tech choices:

- **Next.js** with static export (`output: 'export'`) for GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- No external CMS or database — all content is hardcoded in components

# Implementation Plan

- [x] A: Initialize Next.js project in `site/` with static export and Tailwind CSS
  - [x] A.1: Run `npx create-next-app@latest site` with TypeScript and Tailwind
  - [x] A.2: Configure `next.config.js` for static export (`output: 'export'`)
  - [x] A.3: Set up base layout with global styles (monochrome palette, accent color, clean typography)
- [x] B: Build Hero section
  - [x] B.1: Create Hero component with tagline, one-liner description, and install command CTA
  - [x] B.2: Add GitHub repository link button
  - [x] B.3: Style with responsive layout and clean spacing
- [x] C: Build Features section
  - [x] C.1: Create Features component with a grid/card layout
  - [x] C.2: Add feature cards: spec-driven workflow, Claude Code integration, progress tracking, multi-repo support, templates
  - [x] C.3: Write concise copy for each feature
- [ ] D: Build Install / Getting Started section
  - [ ] D.1: Create Install component with `cargo install tinyspec` code block
  - [ ] D.2: Add quick-start steps (init, new, refine, work)
  - [ ] D.3: Style code blocks with monospace font and copy-to-clipboard
- [ ] E: Layout and polish
  - [ ] E.1: Create Header with logo/wordmark and GitHub link
  - [ ] E.2: Create Footer with links and copyright
  - [ ] E.3: Add favicon, meta tags, and Open Graph tags
  - [ ] E.4: Ensure responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] F: GitHub Pages deployment
  - [ ] F.1: Create GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying to GitHub Pages
  - [ ] F.2: Add CNAME file for custom domain configuration
  - [ ] F.3: Document deployment setup in site README
