# Background

Many specifications share common structure: standard build steps (linting, testing, documentation), recurring task groups, and boilerplate front matter. Currently, every new spec starts from scratch, requiring manual setup of these repeated patterns.

Additionally, task group identifiers are limited to plain letters (A, B, C, ...). Users have expressed interest in using emoji characters as group identifiers (e.g., 🧪 for tests) for more expressive and scannable implementation plans, along with automatic subtask numbering to eliminate manual bookkeeping.

# Proposal

## Template System

Introduce a Markdown-based template system for `tinyspec new`. Templates are regular spec Markdown files that serve as starting points for new specs.

**Storage (two-tier, repo takes precedence):**

- Repo-level: `.specs/templates/`
- User-level: `~/.config/tinyspec/templates/`
- On name conflicts, the repo-level template wins.

**Selection:**

- If a `default` template exists (e.g., `default.md`), it is auto-applied by `tinyspec new` unless overridden.
- The `--template <name>` flag selects a specific template explicitly.
- The default template is optional — if none exists, `tinyspec new` behaves as it does today.

**Substitution:**

- Dynamic values like title and date are substituted into the template content before writing.

## Emoji Task Group IDs

Enhance the parser and formatter to recognize emoji characters as valid task group identifiers. For example:

```
- [ ] 🧪.1: Write unit tests
- [ ] 🧪.2: Write integration tests
- [ ] 🚀.1: Deploy to staging
```

Auto-numbering applies within emoji groups just as it does with letter groups.

# Implementation Plan

- [x] A: Template discovery and resolution
  - [x] A.1: Define template directory conventions (`.specs/templates/`, `~/.config/tinyspec/templates/`)
  - [x] A.2: Implement template scanning — find templates in both locations, repo overrides global on name conflicts
  - [x] A.3: Add `tinyspec templates` command to list available templates with their source (repo/global)
- [x] B: Template application in `tinyspec new`
  - [x] B.1: Add `--template <name>` flag to `tinyspec new`
  - [x] B.2: Auto-apply `default` template when it exists and no `--template` flag is given
  - [x] B.3: Substitute dynamic values (title, date) into template content before writing
- [ ] C: Emoji task group IDs
  - [ ] C.1: Update the task ID parser to recognize emoji characters as valid group identifiers
  - [ ] C.2: Update the formatter to preserve emoji group IDs and auto-number subtasks
  - [ ] C.3: Ensure `tinyspec check`/`uncheck` work with emoji task IDs
