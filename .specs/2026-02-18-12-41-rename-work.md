title: Rename Work
---

# Background

The `tinyspec-work` skill implements a spec's full Implementation Plan by working through task groups in order. The name `work` is generic and doesn't communicate what the skill does at a glance. In context alongside `tinyspec-refine`, `tinyspec-task`, and `tinyspec-oneshot`, a more action-forward name improves discoverability.

# Proposal

Rename `tinyspec-work` → `tinyspec-do` across the codebase. This includes the source skill file, the Rust registration constant, tests, README, and docs. The installed `.claude/skills/` directory is regenerated by `tinyspec init` so it will update automatically when users re-run init.

# Implementation Plan

- [x] A: Rename skill source file
  - [x] A.1: Rename `src/skills/tinyspec-work.md` → `src/skills/tinyspec-do.md`; update front matter (`name: tinyspec:do`)
- [x] B: Update Rust code
  - [x] B.1: Update `src/spec/init.rs` — rename constant `TINYSPEC_WORK_SKILL` → `TINYSPEC_DO_SKILL`, update `include_str!` path, update registration tuple string
- [x] C: Update tests
  - [x] C.1: Update all `tinyspec-work` / `tinyspec:work` references in `tests/integration.rs`
- [x] D: Update docs and README
  - [x] D.1: Update `README.md`
  - [x] D.2: Update `site/app/docs/` pages (`concepts/content.mdx`, `getting-started/content.mdx`, `claude-code/content.mdx`)
  - [x] D.3: Update `site/app/components/Install.tsx`
- [x] E: Run tests
  - [x] E.1: Run `cargo test` and confirm passing
